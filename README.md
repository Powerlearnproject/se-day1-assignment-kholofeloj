Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software using systematic methods.
 Its focus is mainly on creating reliable, efficient, and secure software by applying engineering principles.

- In the tech industry, it helps manage complex systems, ensures software works correctly, scales for growth, remains secure, and reduces long-term costs. Without it, modern tech, from apps to large systems, wouldn't function effectively or safely.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- 1960s: Birth of software engineering to tackle growing software complexity.
- 1970s: Structured programming improved design and maintainability.
- 1990s: Agile methodology introduced flexibility, speed, and customer-focused development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of the following phases:

1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, resources, timeline, and risks.
2. Feasibility Study: Assess technical, financial, and operational feasibility of the project.
3. Design: Create system architecture, UI/UX designs, and database structures.
4. Development: Write and implement the code based on design specifications.
5. Testing: Evaluate the software for bugs, performance, and security issues
6. Deployment: Release the software for use by end users.
7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, fix bugs, and update the software as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall:
- Approach: Linear and sequential, with each phase completed before moving to the next.
- Best for: Projects with fixed, well-defined requirements (e.g., large infrastructure projects).
- Limitations: Less flexible to changes during development.

Agile:
- Approach: Iterative and flexible, with work broken into sprints and continuous feedback.
- Best for: Projects with evolving or unclear requirements (e.g., software, mobile apps).
- Limitations: Less suited for projects with fixed requirements and strict timelines.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
